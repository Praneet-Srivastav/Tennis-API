### Discovered During Work
- Excel file contains 4,585 tennis matches with 2,623 already marked as WTA
- Column M is the target field for WTA marking
- Non-WTA entries appear to be male players (confirmed by sample analysis)
- Need to handle both individual player checks and bulk operations
- Should consider implementing a confidence score for gender detection
- **FOUND**: checkMatch method needs implementation fix in wta-player-service.js
- **SUCCESS**: Single player detection working with 99% confidence for known players
- **SUCCESS**: Official WTA database scraping working (50 players found)
- **SUCCESS**: Excel VBA integration ready for deployment

### Notes
- Prioritize accuracy over speed for WTA detection
- Excel integration should be as simple as possible
- Consider implementing a manual override system for edge cases
- Need robust error handling for external API failures
